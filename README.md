# budding
Budding is a to-do-list app I made for TOP.

I started with the DOM design part first before writing out the logic. The logic is the hardest part. 
I learned that you need to separate the logic from the dom manipulation stuff but had difficulty implementing it.
I didn't know where to put the event-listeners and there were circular dependencies between modules. The architecture was a mess.
Through reading and looking at others' to-do-list projects, I started to have a better idea and began refactoring the code.
Now the program works, but I'm sure there's still a heck ton to learn about organizing your code.
I still have a big knowledge gap to fill in regards to writing a maintainable program, but now that the program kinda works I'll move on to the next part in the curriculum.
